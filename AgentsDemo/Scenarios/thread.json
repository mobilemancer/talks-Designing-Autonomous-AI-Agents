Here’s why that joke works:\n\nIt’s a play on words with a double meaning:\n\n1. **Literal Meaning (Light Attracts Bugs):** In the natural world, bugs (insects) are drawn to light sources, like lamps — so \"light attracts bugs\".\n\n2. **Programming Meaning (\"Bugs\" as Errors):** In software, \"bugs\" are mistakes or problems in code. \"Dark mode\" is a color scheme that many programmers prefer, because it's easier on the eyes and (jokingly) avoids the \"light\".\n\nSo the joke makes a pun: Choosing dark mode helps \"avoid bugs\". In reality, it doesn’t affect bugs (errors) in code, but it does link the two meanings in a clever, nerdy way. That's why it's funny to programmers!"
