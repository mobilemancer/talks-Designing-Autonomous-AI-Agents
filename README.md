# talks-Designing-Autonomous-AI-Agents

Artificial Intelligence is trending, and 2025 is said to be the year of agents. And no, not as in Mr Smith, but as in small AI systems, empowered to act on the users behalf.

This presentation provides a practical guide to building AI agents using the .NET ecosystem, and Azure services like AI Foundry.
We'll be looking at how we can give the agents reasoning. What are the best models, and why?
Additionally, we'll explore ways to make our agents smarter by giving them memory, access to tools and the ability to evolve over time. Hopefully without recreating our own version of Mr Smith...
